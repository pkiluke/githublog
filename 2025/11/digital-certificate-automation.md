# Introduction
Welcome dear readers,

Today, I will introduce the foundations of [post-quantum cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography) (hereafter referred to as PQC) and its implications to data protection. The PQC is one of the emerging technologies, by many considered to be to 2025 what AI was to 2024, that has a huge potential to impact, and by impact, I mean break, data confidentiality and data integrity.
